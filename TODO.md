## REMINDER On the Implementation Process: (DONT REMOVE THIS SECTION)
- For each change:
  1. **Baseline Verification:**
     - Run backend tests: `cd backend && go test ./...` âœ“
     - Run mobile tests: `cd mobile && npm test` âœ“
     - Run linting: `cd backend && golangci-lint run` âœ“
     - Check mobile type safety: `cd mobile && npm run type-check` âœ“

  2. **Pre-Change Verification:**
     - Run targeted tests relevant to the component being modified âœ“
     - Test API endpoints with curl or Thunder Client âœ“
     - Test mobile screens in Expo Go app âœ“

  3. **Make Required Changes:**
     - Follow KISS and YAGNI principles âœ“
     - Maintain consistent code style (Go: gofmt, TypeScript: Prettier) âœ“
     - Document weasel mode features with clear psychological rationale âœ“
     - **For database changes:**
       - Create proper migrations with rollback capability
       - Test migrations on sample data
       - Update API endpoints and mobile models accordingly
     - **For weasel mode features:**
       - Implement user controls for intensity levels
       - Add metrics tracking for psychological intervention effectiveness
       - Ensure features remain helpful despite manipulation tactics
     - **NEW REMINDER:** Test both backend API and mobile app integration frequently. Don't wait until the end of a feature.

  4. **Post-Change Verification:**
     - Run targeted tests to verify the changes work as expected âœ“
     - Test end-to-end workflows (registration â†’ onboarding â†’ workout logging) âœ“
     - Verify mobile app hot reload works correctly âœ“
     - Run full test suite: `cd backend && go test ./...` âœ“
     - Run mobile tests: `cd mobile && npm test` âœ“
     - **CRITICAL:** Test weasel mode features don't become genuinely harmful or overly annoying

  5. **Git Commit:**
     - Stop after completing a logical portion of a feature to make well reasoned git commits âœ“
     - Request suggested git commands for committing the changes âœ“
     - Use conventional commit format: `feat: add user registration with weasel onboarding` âœ“
     - Review and execute the git commit commands yourself âœ“

  6. **Building and Testing Hints:**
     - Backend: `cd backend && go run cmd/server/main.go` starts development server
     - Mobile: `cd mobile && npm start` starts Expo development server
     - Database: `docker run --name liftbuddy-db -e POSTGRES_DB=liftbuddy_dev -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:15`
     - Full setup: `./scripts/dev-setup.sh` runs automated development setup
     - API testing: Use `curl` commands or Thunder Client extension in VS Code
     - Mobile testing: Scan QR code with Expo Go app, shake device for developer menu

##END REMINDER On the Implementation Process:

## Testing Strategy Notes
- **Unit Tests:** Focus on weasel message selection algorithms, progress calculation inflation, and psychological trigger logic
- **Integration Tests:** Test complete user flows from registration through workout completion with weasel interventions
- **Psychological Testing:** A/B test different weasel mode intensities and message types for optimal engagement without annoyance
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Ensure features remain helpful and motivational despite manipulation tactics
- **Performance Testing:** Verify notification systems don't overwhelm users or drain battery life

## Weasel Mode Ethics Guidelines
- **Transparency:** Users should understand they're being psychologically influenced (make it part of the fun)
- **Beneficial Manipulation:** All psychological techniques should ultimately help users build healthy habits
- **User Control:** Always provide granular controls for weasel mode intensity
- **Escape Hatches:** Allow users to disable or reduce psychological pressure when needed
- **Self-Aware Humor:** Keep manipulation tactics lighthearted and obviously intentional (not deceptive)

## Success Metrics
- **Core Metrics:** Workout completion rate, user retention (7-day, 30-day), buddy invitation acceptance rate
- **Weasel Effectiveness:** Notification response rate by message type, workout completion after intervention
- **User Satisfaction:** App store ratings, user complaints vs compliments about weasel mode
- **Engagement:** Time spent in app, feature usage patterns, streak maintenance rates
- **Social Features:** Buddy relationship creation and maintenance, social pressure response rates
